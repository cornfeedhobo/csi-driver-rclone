## VS Code devcontainer

A [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
is included to provide a predictable workspace.

This is not intended to be used when building for release.

## TODO

- Add helm chart logic to handle rclone rcd authentication.
- Add support for getting the driver config from a k8s secret.
- Add support for listing volumes.
- Document how to use the driver with Docker.
